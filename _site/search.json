    "text": "Welcome to our website dedicated to our IS415 Geospatial Analytics project! Here, we embark on an exploration of spatial data analysis, leveraging cutting-edge techniques to glean insights from geographic information. Our journey involves delving into diverse datasets, uncovering patterns, and drawing meaningful conclusions. \nTo have a better idea on the government’s effort on waste reduction in Hong Kong, we would like to focus on the GREEN@COMMUNITY initiative promoted by the Environmental Protection Department of Hong Kong. As at mid-February 2024, a total of 11 Recycling Stations, 40 Recycling Stores and over 130 Recycling Spots have been set up throughout the 18 districts in Hong Kong under GREEN@COMMUNITY for the collection of nine common types of recyclables (LCQ17: Promoting Waste Reduction and Recycling, 2024) In our project, we will be analysing the locations of these and evaluate if the coverage of this initiative is sufficient. To go beyond, we will try to come up with solutions on where to add new recycling stations. In the Shiny Application, we will be creating an interactive map with features that users can zoom in/out on the map, do filtering of results and searching functions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "In the Waste Blueprint 2035 by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) in 2021, Hong Kong aims to reach a 55% recovery rate as a mid-term target. As of 2022, Hong Kong is at 32% recovery rate. To reach the target in around 10 years time, Hong Kong has to make more efforts in achieving the target in time. \nGiven Hong Kong has a very high population density, with 6,740 people per square kilometre , there is a pressing need to assess the distribution and accessibility of recycling stations across the islands. This geospatial analysis aims to investigate whether there are a sufficient number of recycling stations located throughout Hong Kong to effectively serve its population. \nBy examining the spatial distribution of existing recycling facilities in relation to population, residential areas, and commercial districts, this study seeks to identify potential gaps in coverage and areas with inadequate access to recycling services. The findings will provide valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and waste management authorities to optimise the placement and allocation of recycling infrastructure, ultimately fostering greater participation in recycling efforts and contributing to sustainable waste management practices in Hong Kong."
